# 🧮 Math Game

## 📖 About the Project
A simple and interactive **C++ console-based math game** where the player solves randomly generated math questions.

The game challenges the player with different **arithmetic operations** and difficulty levels.  
It keeps track of correct and wrong answers and gives feedback after each round.

This project is part of the **AbouHadhood Platform** training track with Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud and is designed to practice:
- Functions & clean code structure
- Enums and structs
- Random number generation
- Loops and conditions
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

---

## 🛠 Built With
- **C++**
- `<iostream>`
- `<cstdlib>` (random number generation)
- `<ctime>` (random seed)

---

## 🎯 Game Features
- Multiple math operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide)
- Random questions every round
- Score tracking
- Clear round-based flow
- Console-based user interaction

## 🧩 Example

Choose number of questions: <kbd>3</kbd>  
Choose difficulty level: <kbd>2</kbd>  
Choose operation type: <kbd>+</kbd>

Question [1/3]:  
5 + 7 = ?  
Your Answer: <kbd>12</kbd> ✅

Question [2/3]:  
9 + 4 = ?  
Your Answer: <kbd>10</kbd> ❌
